      <h2>TERMS OF <span style="color: #233241;">USE.</span></h2>

      <p style="color: #233241; text-decoration: none;">
        The terms of use constitute the plagiarism policy and the liability(new
        name) policy. Choosing to be a mentor or mentee entails that the
        plagiarism policy and the liability policy are agreed to. We require
        these are read before a decision to join UNi-ED is made and a decision
        to join UNi-ED as a mentor or mentee entails an agreement to abide by
        these policies.
      </p>

      <h4 style="color: #233241; text-decoration: none;">Plagiarism Policy</h4>
      <p style="color: #233241; text-decoration: none;">
        UNi-ED aims to provide a tool, in the form of mentors, to help high
        school students strengthen their understanding of a country’s
        application systems, colleges and financial aid opportunities. Using
        this augmented understanding, HSS are required to complete their
        applications using their own abilities.

        <br />
        <br />

        At no point during the mentorship process may any mentee plagiarise any
        material the mentor shares with them and use it towards their own
        application. This clearly violates the rules of the college application
        process and UNi-ED’s ethos. Plagiarism of any intellectual property that
        a mentor may share is strongly condemned by UNi-ED.

        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, UNi-ED mentors must not, at any point, directly edit any
        aspect of the mentee’s application portfolio; this includes all material
        required to complete an application any university.

        <br />
        <br />

        Doing so would violate the terms of use for UNi-ED. Upon becoming aware
        of plagiarism, a mentor is required to report this to UNi-ED.

        <ul>
<li>
  By agreeing to be a mentor, the college student agrees to abide by the aforementioned, including reporting any plagiarism and not facilitating plagiarism. 

</li>
<li>
  By agreeing to be a mentee, the individual agrees to abide by the aforementioned, including not plagiarising any intellectual property a mentor may share for inspiration. 

</li>

        </ul>
      </p>

        UNi-ED aims to provide a tool, in the form of mentors, to help high

        provided by a UNi-ED mentor is fully at the discretion of the mentee.
        UNi-ED is not liable for any consequences a mentee faces by directly
        applying a UNi-ED mentor’s advice.

        <br />
        <br />

        At all junctures, a mentee must use their agency to make decisions
        concerning their university application portfolio, irrespective of the
        advice they receive from a UNi-ED mentor. By agreeing to
